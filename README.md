# BTH650 Group Project - Winter 2024 - SmartCart

## Project Purpose

### Overview and Significance 

The significance of this app would be to modernize the in-store shopping experience for customers. Many grocery stores are starting to lag in shopper experience with the most modern thing about them being the self-checkout experience. SmartCart aims to provide customers with a smoother and more efficient shopping experience, while also providing critical customer data to grocery stores such as customer paths taken, time in store, items bought, etc.

### Target Audience

The target users for this app would be mainly adults who go grocery store shopping in person. This app would be most useful to individuals already familiar with similar applications, such as navigation apps and online shopping. Price check features and item detail browsing clientele will broaden drastically over time as self-checkout becomes more common, therefore continuing to familiarize shoppers with the process. 

### Application Vision

This app would be used on touch screens installed on shopping carts in grocery stores. The purpose of this app is to provide shoppers with a mobile aid while they shop. Some key features include:

#### Navigation

The application can have a basic navigation service to guide the user to things such as specific products, checkout locations, and other things like bathrooms if the store has one. This can also be built to include features such as reporting similar to Waze to do things such as reporting a spill/mess or any other issues in the store to employees.

#### Search

The application should support the ability to search for specific items find the location of the item in-store, and notify the user if there is currently low, or no stock.

#### FAQ

A section that can show answers to basic questions about the store, or the app. For example, when does the current sale end, or what is the store return policy? 

#### Call for live support

The application should support a simple live support option that can ping employees within the store to send a physical worker for customer assistance if necessary. 

#### Price Check

The device itself should contain a price check option for users. This can be implemented with scanners or with cameras, and once the product is found it should display detailed item information such as brand, volume, price per gram, etc.


### Future Technology Adaptation

In the future, the application services can be ported over to items such as AR glasses as the technology becomes more mainstream, for example containing the ability to look at a product and display the price above it, or to have navigation markers appear on the floor in front of the user to guide them to specific products.

### Competitors

To gauge the possible success of our application, we can look at other applications that provide a similar service that our application would provide.
The Navigation aspect can take inspiration from other simple navigation software like Google Maps, the reporting feature can also be useful in a store environment to alert workers to the status of their store in real-time.
In terms of the application working within the grocery store environment, Sobeys has implemented their test pilot of a ‘Smart Cart’ however this was a pilot and limited to one store, but served as an interesting proof of concept for what we are aiming to achieve. ’
Another example would be the Amazon Fresh grocery store. The store is one of the most high-tech grocery stores, however, there are few of them and they are very high-tech and hard to open on a large scale, while our application can be integrated better with existing stores.

## Project Design Choices

### Final App Features

The final interface has search and scan features, an FAQ, a call for live employee assistance, a basic navigation menu to help users find their way around the store, and a checkout once items have been added to the cart. 

### Color Choices

Green was used as the main color for the application. Being an application concerned with groceries, it was important to communicate an energy of health, wealth, wellbeing and nature. These are all positive colors to emphasize in a grocery store environment which makes it a common color scheme for store chains and produce sections. 

There is also a shade of green being used that is a lighter tint to utilize for highlighting different UI components such as buttons, as text can appear against this lighter tint for a greater contrast. 

Normal Text is colored as a dark gray as opposed to a pure black to be easier on the eyes, while bold text and headings are left as pure black to emphasize their importance.

Our color scheme is overall a green, monochromatic color scheme as it makes use of different tints of green as the main colors in the application. 

### Typography

The font chosen for this project was DMSans as it is a clean font that is appropriate for smaller sizes, which can be utilized in our Interface as smaller values such as item prices need to be displayed cleanly and legibly. We chose 4 sizes of fonts in both regular and bold fonts, and with appropriate line-height to use without the app depending on whether they were needed for lengthy explanations such as in the FAQ page, or if they needed to be attention-grabbing such as in the headers.

### Icons

The icons needed were grabbed from the Iconify plugin for Figma, which allowed for an easy import of vector shapes into the project and also assisted with gaining a consistent feel across all the icons used across the interface due to being from the same library.
